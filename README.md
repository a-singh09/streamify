## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-singh09/streamify.git
```


2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd streamify
npm install
```


3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```


4. Run the production server:
```bash
npm run build   # Builds to static files
```
```bash
npm start      # Starts the production server
```


5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 1. Component Architecture
- Used shadcn/ui for consistent design system
- Separated chart components for better maintainability
- Implemented responsive design patterns

### 2. State Management
- Used React's useState for local state
- Opted for prop drilling for simplicity given the app's current scope
- Could be extended with Context or Redux for larger scale

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Implemented responsive container for charts
- Used client-side components only where necessary
- Optimized mobile layout for better performance

### 4. Future Improvements
- Add real-time data fetching
- Add more dashboard features
- Enhance mobile experience
- Add data export functionality

### 5. Trade-offs
1. Using local state with useState instead of global state management.

2. Using Recharts which have limited customization compared to D3.js. For example, the text is not visible properly sometimes or get covered etc.
